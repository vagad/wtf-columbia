WTF Columbia (What to Fix Columbia)

Project Members: Vamsi Gadiraju, Nick Liu, Maria Casciani

This is a project based around helping Columbia students express their 
complaints about the school. It is a Reddit-style forum that uses MongoLabs 
and Node to provide students with a way to comment on the page about 
problems that they have encountered at the school. Comments can be upvoted 
or downvoted. Based on the comments, student government can make efforts 
to address the issues students face most often and can show off their work 
through a fixed problem icon next to a comment. Google Authentication is 
used and all posters MUST have a Columbia/Barnard ID to post.
